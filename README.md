# Image-Caption-Generator

Automatically describing the content of an image
is a fundamental problem in AI that connects
CV and NLP. So our goal is, given an image, the
method can output an English sentence describing
itâ€™s content, we present a generative model based
on a DNN architecture that combines recent advances
in CV and machine translation.

The code contains the whole procoess of pre processing, feature extraction, making vocabulary, converting words to indexes, training the model, evaluating the model, predictions.
