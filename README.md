# Image-Caption-Generator

Automatically describing the content of an image
is a fundamental problem in AI that connects
CV and NLP. So our goal is, given an image, the
method can output an English sentence describing
itâ€™s content, we present a generative model based
on a DNN architecture that combines recent advances
in CV and machine translation.
